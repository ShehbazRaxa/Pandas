Working with arrays using python library numpy                                                                                 
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning
Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. 
Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. 
Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. 
Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. 
The different layers of a CNN. There are four types of layers for a convolutional neural network: the convolutional layer, the pooling layer, 
the ReLU correction layer and the fully-connected layer.
